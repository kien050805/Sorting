# Project_1


## Overview
- The project has implementation of several sorting algorithm: insertion_sort, merge_sort, quicksort, and two variation of quick_sort.

## Structure
* The project contains:
    - The two main files are sorting.hpp and sorting.cpp.
        + sorting.hpp contains all of the functions definitions.
        + sorting.cpp contains all of the functions implementations.
    - The Makefile that compiles the executables.
    - The mytests.cpp file which contains test cases for the created functions.

## Design Decisions
- For both merge and quick sort, we decided to have additional functions instead of incorporating everything into one single function.

## Group Challenges
- The requirement of having only two parameters for each function was difficult to navigate.

## Individual Reflection
- We've split the work evenly so each of us contributed to the implementation of several functions. Personally, I've done:
    + Sorting Algorithms: insertion_sort, merge_sort
    + Runtime_Analysis: created functions to get the run time of the sorting algorithms
    + Documentation
